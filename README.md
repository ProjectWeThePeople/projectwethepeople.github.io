# Project We The People

"Hello, World."

The purpose of this software is to unite humanity. It's about time we all got on the same page. 

This software will enable every user to write down sentences they believe are always true for them. A "radian" of their reality. Users will then be able to group their radians together to form a "truth" circle. Then functionality will be built to allow them to see how their circles connect themselves to the people around them. 


For now, the first goal is to provide a user interface that enables the creation and sharing of "truth" circles. It will keep track of each users' circles, what connections were made to their circles, and when their circles changed, if they changed.

Sounds fun.

Things we are going to need but dont have yet: *Would be nice if I had some help.*

User authentication.
A database system that uses a blockchain to presevere, verify, and store changes made by every user.
Servers to host the program.
Software that faciliates the creation of the user circles, I think I will be using Godot for this.
