# ProjectWeThePeople

The purpose of this software is to unite humanity under a banner that represents all that is good in this world. 

Right now the best idea the author and originator of this software has for doing so is to create a program that allows every person alive to get on the same page with one another. 

This software will enable every user to create a circle of their own truths and see how that circle connects to those around them. 

Probably through a series of "if this" then "this" statements combined with "if this and this and this and this, then that equals this new meaning sentence/connection."

Sounds fun. 


Each truth will represent a "radian" of their reality. A rule that always works, a rule that is always true. The collection of those truth radians will form a circle. 

This software will provide a user interface that enables the creation and sharing of truth circles amongst humanity. It will keep track of each users' circle, what connections were made to their circle, and when their circle changed, if it changed.
